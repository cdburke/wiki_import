== JKeyboard ==
This is the <i>JKeyboard</i> from Michael Dykman. Go to <i>Settings</i> >> <i>Language & Input</i> to activate <i>JKeyboard</i>.  We do not collect your data. Finally scroll up and select <i>JKeyboard</i> in the <i>default</i> box.

== SystemFolders ==
<tt>$EXTERNAL_STORAGE</tt> is the path of the emulated sdcard folder which is usually <tt>/storage/emulated/0</tt>,

<pre>
~install  $EXTERNAL_STORAGE/Android/data/com.jsoftware.j.android/files
~bin      /data/data/com.jsoftware.j.android/app_jandroid/bin
~system   ~install/system
~addons   ~install/addons
~user     $EXTERNAL_STORAGE/j64-807-user or $EXTERNAL_STORAGE/j807-user
~home     $EXTERNAL_STORAGE
</pre>

other folders will be under <i>~user</i>

<pre>
~break
~config
~projects
~snap
~temp
</pre>

<i>~break</i> is empty and will not be used.

Upon uninstall, all files under <i>~install</i> will be removed by Android.

== File permission ==
Prior to Android 6 (except Kitkat), files on emulated sdcard and sdcard (except some special folders) are public and can be read and written by all users/apps. Explicit storage permission is required on Android 6 or newer are required for J Android to work properly.

Files under <i>/data/data/{android apps}</i> are owned by the respective apps, and not accessible by other Android apps such as text editor, image viewer.

== Location of Shared Libraries ==
== Startup Files ==

<pre>
~install/bin/profile.ijs
~install/bin/profilex.ijs         NB. if present
~home/.jprofile.ijs               NB. if present
~install/bin/startup_android.ijs  NB. if present
</pre>

profilex.ijs is typically used for setting up system folders.  Other customization can be put in either .jprofile.ijs .

== Jconsole ==
Command line frontend <tt>jconsole</tt> or <tt>jconsole-nopie</tt> executable is available with full path name under

<pre>
jpath '~bin/../libexec
or
/data/data/com.jsoftware.j.android/app_jandroid/libexec
</pre>

Its file permission is 755.  There is no visible icon for jconsole on Android screen.

It can be called from J using <tt>2!:0</tt> or <tt>2!:1</tt> in a non-interactive mode.

Certain Android Apps such as Shell and Terminal Emulator can run jconsole in an interactive mode.

==  Async Mode ==
By default jandroid run in sync mode but it can also run in async mode where J engine runs in separate thread. The following features requires async mode

* console keyboard input of <tt>1!:1[1</tt> and <i>explicit definition</i>

* debug and suspension (GUI debug not supported)

Use wd command to switch between sync and async mode,

<pre>
wd 'setj asyncj 0'   NB. sync
wd 'setj asyncj 1'   NB. async
</pre>

and restart J to take effect.


==  Force Update ==
The Android APK file contains system base library and some addons. Whenever jandroid starts, it will check the version number stored in

<pre>
~install/assets_version.txt
</pre>

to determine if it needs to decompress and overwriting files.  If you want to decompress files again, type
<pre>
dver ''
</pre>

and restart J, and then quit again to finish install.

jandroid will switch back to the default sync mode.

== Limitation ==
* printing not yet supported

* keyboard shortcut is not supported

* some addons such as FFTW do not work because of missing shared libraries.

== Known issues ==
* when jandroid has been killed by Android after a long in-activity period, jandroid can not restart and will crash.
